# Video Processing and Frame Extraction Project

## Project Overview
This project is an automated tool designed to process videos, extract frames, and upload selected frames to Google Drive. It's particularly useful for researchers, content creators, or anyone working with video analysis who needs to extract and store specific frames from long videos.

## Key Features

1. **Video Download**: Automatically downloads a specified video from a given URL.
2. **Video Splitting**: Divides the downloaded video into manageable parts.
3. **Frame Extraction**: Extracts frames from each video part at a specified frame rate.
4. **Frame Selection**: Allows for the selection of specific frames for further processing.
5. **Google Drive Integration**: Uploads selected frames to Google Drive and generates shareable links.

## Project Aims

- Simplify the process of extracting frames from long videos.
- Provide an efficient way to split videos into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Automate the upload and sharing of selected video frames.
- Facilitate easier collaboration and sharing of video frame data.

## How It Works

1. **Video Acquisition**: The tool downloads a specified video from a provided URL.
2. **Processing**: 
   - The video is split into multiple parts (default is 30-minute segments).
   - Frames are extracted from each part at a rate of 1 frame per second.
3. **Frame Selection**: Users can select specific frames for further processing.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Selected frames are uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder.
5. **Sharing**: The tool generates and provides shareable links for the uploaded frames.

## Use Cases

- **Research**: Analyzing specific moments in lengthy video recordings.
- **Content Creation**: Extracting key frames from video content for thumbnails or promotional materials.
- **Video Analysis**: Studying frame-by-frame changes in long-duration videos.
- **Data Collection**: Gathering visual data from videos for machine learning projects.

## Technical Details

- Developed to run in a Google Colab environment.
- Utilizes Python libraries including `gdown`, `ffmpeg-python`, and Google API client libraries.
- Integrates with Google Drive API for cloud storage and sharing capabilities.

## Requirements

- Google Colab notebook.
- Google Drive account.
- Google Cloud project with Drive API enabled.
- Service account credentials for Google Drive API.

## Setup and Usage

Detailed instructions for setting up and using this tool are provided in the project's documentation. This includes steps for:
- Setting up the Google Colab environment.
- Configuring Google Drive API access.
- Running the script and customizing parameters.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Designed primarily for use in Google Colab; may require modifications for other environments.
- Depends on Google Drive storage capacity and API usage limits.
- Processing time may vary based on video length and complexity.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a user interface for easier parameter adjustment.
- Add support for batch processing of multiple videos.
- Integrate with other cloud storage services.
- Develop a standalone application version.
